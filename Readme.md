# Physics-informed deep-learning applications to experimental fluid mechanics

## Introduction
The code in this repository features a Python implemention of Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for applications to experimental fluid mechanics. The input data are spatial coordinates (*x*, *y*) only taken at the domain boundaries. 

More details about the implementation and results from the training are available in ["Physics-informed deep-learning applications to experimental fluid mechanics", Hamidreza Eivazi, Yuning Wang, Ricardo Vinuesa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15402)(2022,*Physics of Fluids*)

## Pre-requisites
The code was run successfully using Tensorflow>=2.6.0, using 1 GPU for training. In addition, scipy is necessary for implementing optimization algorithm

## Data
The dataset used for training and testing are available in order to ensure the reproducibility of the results.

##  Training and inference
The PINNs training and prediction can be performed after cloning the repository. 

Take *cylinder_wake* as example:
    
    git clone  https://github.com/KTH-FlowAI/Physics-informed-deep-learning-applications-to-experimental-fluid-mechanics.git
    cd cylinder_wake/training
    python training.py


For postprocessing the reults, it can be performed as follows:
    
    cd ../post-processing
    python plot_cylinder_pod.py


Note that for running the *2D_Burgers*, the data is required to be generated by running the code. To do this: 

    cd 2D_Burgers
    python Burgers_2d_solve.py
